# ðŸ“– Abductive Reasoning: A Literature Review of the State of the Art  

This repository contains supporting material for my bachelor's thesis titled:  
**"Abductive Reasoning: A Literature Review of the State of the Art."**  

It is a purely theoretical research work in which I analyzed and classified the main models based on **Abductive Learning**, an innovative framework that combines:  
- **Inductive reasoning** (Machine Learning)  
- **Abductive reasoning** (Logical Reasoning)  

### ðŸ“Œ Overview of the Research  
The study begins with an exploration of the **philosophical foundations** behind different types of reasoning. Then, it delves into the workings of **Abductive Learning**, examining:  
- The **concept behind its development**  
- Its **framework**  
- The **metrics** used to evaluate its performance, comparing it with other models  

Finally, the thesis provides a **taxonomy** of all models based on Abductive Learning, as well as other approaches that explicitly integrate **abductive reasoning** as a core structure within their frameworks.  

### ðŸ“œ Abstract
Abduction is a form of reasoning that involves generating the most plausible explanation for a set of observations, and it plays a critical role in various fields, including scientific discovery, diagnostic systems, and natural language understanding. This thesis aims to explore the integration of abductive reasoning within Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly through Abductive Learning (ABL). Historically, machine learning (ML) and logical reasoning have evolved separately due to their differing representations: â€™feature-valueâ€™ in ML and â€™first-order logicâ€™ rules in reasoning. The ABL framework aims to integrate ML and logical reasoning in a balanced manner, distinguishing it from previous models. This thesis conducts a comprehensive taxonomy by examining state-of-the-art implementations of ABL and other related models that utilize abduction.
